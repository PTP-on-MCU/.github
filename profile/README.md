This organization is a collaborative workspace for engineers interested in exploring hardware PTP support available on some microcontrollers, notably from ST Micro and NXP. These chips appear to rely on the same Ethernet MAC IP block from Synopsys. Their PTP features are, to be blunt, poorly documented.

That is why this organization's symbol is a melting clock, from Dali's painting "The Persistence of Memory". It represents a world where time does not function reliably and therefore, by extension, nothing can really be trusted to work logically.

PTP is meant to help with reliability. This organization is meant to help understand PTP hardware logic.

The plan is to create and maintain simple software projects demonstrating individual features of the hardware, such as 1PPS signal generation. The goal is to reconcile observed behavior in the hardware with what the manufacturers' documentation says. Ultimately, fully-documented implementations of PTP will be hosted here.
